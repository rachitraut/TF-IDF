joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.


What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?

For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?

As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
life at least 2/7, viz. 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher
he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a
physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
