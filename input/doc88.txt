Vain: very.

He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught

jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band,

     _Those girls, those girls,
     Those lovely seaside girls._


Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,

Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait.
